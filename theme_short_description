Today, we have to struggle a lot to find opportunities either to obtain part-time jobs and
experience to begin careers or to make our idea possible.
Many students are actively seeking job opportunities, while startups are often in need of talent to help bring their ideas to life.

Here comes our project that connects beginner developer or devlover students/enthusiasts to professionals
or startups. Through our project, startups can get their work done or find new partners that help them grow their ideas.
Beginners can get part-time freelancing opportunities and gain hands-on experience.
Our project allows students to locate freelance jobs that match their interests, establish portfolios, and earn while they learn. 
They can earn in realtime, and our project also serves as a mediator for both freelancers and employers.
This connects education with employment through features such as skill-based job matching,
mentorship from advanced students and professionals, and learning modules with micro-certifications.
